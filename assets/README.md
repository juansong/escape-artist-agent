# Assets

This folder contains **static demo assets** for the project, such as:

- Example plots (learning curves, value heatmaps, rollout trajectories).
- Animated GIFs generated from training runs.
- Any images embedded into the main `README.md`.

⚠️ Note:
- Figures generated automatically during training are saved under `runs/<exp_name>/figs/`.
- Only selected demo visuals should be copied here for presentation purposes.
- A `.gitkeep` file ensures this folder is always tracked, even if empty.
